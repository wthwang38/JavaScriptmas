Challenge 1: Favorite Foods
- Topic: Object Destructuring
1. Edit the faveFoods object so that it contains 
your favorite foods.
2. Destructure the faveFoods object into three consts: 
breakfast, lunch, and supper.
3. Fetch the meals <section> from the DOM.
4. Set the innerHTML content of the meals <section> to a paragraph
that states what your favorite foods are for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
Use a template literal to construct the string.

E.g.
For breakfast, I only like croissants 🥐. For lunch, I love pasta 🍝, 
and for supper I want usually want pizza 🍕.

const faveFoods = {
    breakfast: 'croissants',
    lunch: 'sausages',
    supper: 'hotdogs'
}

const { breakfast, lunch, supper } = faveFoods

let meal = document.querySelector("#meals")
meal.innerHTML = `For breakfast, I only like ${breakfast}. For lunch, I love ${lunch}, 
and for supper I want usually want ${supper}`
